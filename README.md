# What is this
It takes places from somewhere, processes this places, gives you opportunity to cluster them and exports as areas - clustered groups of this places.

# Two main goals
## Phase no 1 : Prepare
During this goal you have several steps available.
### Import
Import your data from somewhere. Currently CSV import (tsv) is available
### Validate
Data should be valid, isn't it? If data is invalid we shouldn'r process that.
### Filter
Places that are not of interest to us we should exclude. As a difference to previous subtask this is not an error when we find something 
that is just not matchin filter criteria. It's just something filtered-out.
### Locate
Using cache or locator places has to be assigned with lat and long to localise them.

## Phase no 2 : Cluster
### Starting point
Places that you have now are valid, filtered, located places. We may have them after whole Phase no#1 steps. Or you may import data from import area.
There you have two files needed to import. Places and Areas. Both files (.json) should be provided here as a start.

### Cluster them
The main goal now is to assign every place to it's area. First you have to have area. Add new area please! Then you can assign places to it.
Just type "1,2,3" to the input edit next to area and places with numbers 1,2,3 will be assigned to this area.

### Save your work
Don't forget to save your work, especially when you are going somewhere for more than 5 minutes. It has to be done this way:
1. Click "Save ALL" button at top
2. There are 2 files that has been created, you have info about that after saving
3. Donwload both files to your PC
